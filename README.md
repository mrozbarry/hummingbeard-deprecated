Why make another chat client?
-----------------------------

Many available chat clients are not extendable, or are only available using a freemium model.  This is not acceptable.  Web developers should have the ability to grab a simple chat widget and just use it, regardless of their protocol.  Chat clients should also be customizable, while using simple markup.  Chat clients should also have easy to follow code.  I believe hummingbeard does all these things, and does them well.
